# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
python has been a challenge for me because its nothing like anyhting ive ever done before. Ive never really been the very best with computers and it got to be overwhelming at times not knowing how the programs worked and what each word meant, but I think ive gotten enough of a hang of it to say im at least a little familiar.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
I have never really used any other programming language in the past and because of that python was very new to me when we had out first intro lesson. I think python works a little like how math does in some way, using very straightforard logic to come ot conclusions.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I used chat gpt to help teach me how to make a passord generator and a random number guessing game. Although for most of it, it was hard to come to conclusions on my own about how to go aobut certain commands and codes that do different things, chat gpt was very helpful in giving hints and guidance during the process.
